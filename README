This is a Flask web app that interacts with ffmirror to allow you to view a
local fanfiction mirror over the Web. It fulfills the same purpose as the
now-obsolete server.py in ffmirror.

To run, 1. install Flask, 2. run ffserve.py on the command line. This runs
Flask's development server, which may be adequate for low-traffic local use. If
you wish to run it in public, or with higher traffic, for some godforsaken
reason, you should use one of the options for Flask deployment to a real Web
server.
