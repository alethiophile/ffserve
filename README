This is a Flask web app that interacts with ffmirror to allow you to view a
local fanfiction mirror over the Web. It fulfills the same purpose as the
now-obsolete server.py in ffmirror.

To run, 1. install Flask, 2. run ffserve.py on the command line. This runs
Flask's development server, which may be adequate for low-traffic local use. If
you wish to run it in public, or with higher traffic, for some godforsaken
reason, you should use one of the options for Flask deployment to a real Web
server.

Warning: The provided configuration file sets DEBUG=True. When this
configuration is set, the Web client can run arbitrary Python code on your
server through the debugger. You should change this unless you're sure you trust
your local network.
